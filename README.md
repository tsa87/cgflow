> This repository contains the codebase used to reproduce the results from our [ICML 2025 submission](https://openreview.net/forum?id=4aXfSLfM0Z): **"Compositional Flows for 3D Molecule and Synthesis Pathway Co-design."**  For production-ready code or commercial use, please contact the authors directly or refer to most recent version.

# Compositional Flows for 3D Molecule and Synthesis Path Co-design

We introduce Compositional Generative Flows (CGFlow), a novel framework that extends flow matching to generate objects in compositional steps while modeling continuous states. We apply CGFlow to synthesizable drug design by jointly designing the moleculeâ€™s synthetic pathway with its 3D binding pose.

## Setup

### Install

```
# python: 3.11
conda install unidock
pip install -e . --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.1+cu121.html

# For PoseCheck
pip install -e '.[extra]' --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.1+cu121.html
```

### Data

#### Data for 3DSynthFlow pose prediction pretraining

For convenience, we provide preprocessed data files for training pose prediction [here](https://figshare.com/s/fa64ce287f9bfc8beaba) Simply copy the `smol` folder from the CrossDock dataset and reference it when running the scripts. For example, specify `--data_path path/to/data/crossdock/smol` as an argument when executing the script.

#### Building block generation for 3DSynthFlow

The Enamine building block library is available upon request at https://enamine.net/building-blocks/building-blocks-catalog.
We used the "Comprehensive Catalog" released at 2024.06.10.

```
cd data
python scripts/a_catalog_to_smi.py -b <CATALOG_SDF> -o building_blocks/enamine_catalog.smi --cpu <CPU>
python scripts/b_create_env.py -b building_blocks/enamine_catalog.smi -o envs/catalog/ --cpu <CPU>
```

## Experiments

You can train state flow model for pose prediction using the following command:
```
sh scripts/A_semlaflow_train_crossdocked.sh
```
You can also directly download the pretrained model weights using the [same link](https://figshare.com/s/fa64ce287f9bfc8beaba).

To reproduce the results on the 15 targets from LIT-PCBA, run the following command:
```
cd experiments/
wandb sweep sweep/redock.yaml
wandb agent {sweep-id}
```
